title: Are PeachyBbies' Jelly and Cloud Creme Slimes Really Worth Your Money?
---

PeachyBbies has been reviewed numerous times on youtube. Some of them are honest reviews. When Christina Danks reviewed 
Peachybbies in 2018, she bought a cloud creme from peachybbies. The slime did not come in the best condition. It was rippy, 
and was dried out, and it had a ton of snow fallout. Christina added lotion to the slime and it made it worse; it made the 
beads to fall out.

However, later that year, Parakeet Slimes (another huge slime shop) bought a cloud creme from peachybbies and it came just 
fine. There was no fallout, it was stretchy,and it felt good on her hands. But, Parakeet Slimes also bought a jelly slime 
from peachybbies, and that was super rippy and hard and really unplayable. and It was very hard to play with. 
According to Parakeet Slimes, she said in the video, "I thought maybe it was just the weather, so I warmed it up in front
of my heater for like 10-20 minutes I don't know I just left it there. And it was very warm, it melted down a bit, but still it
was so stiff and hard like no matter how soft it was, it was still so stiff and hard." 

If you guys had experiences with Peachybbies, please comment them down below so I could know because I might buy from her soon :). 

Hope you enjoyed this very first post, and dont forget to have a slimey day! Bye!
